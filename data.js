That is the historical construct that <a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/topics/xi-jinping\">Xi Jinping</a> and the party have presented as a way to understand the 19th party congress and the next 15-30 years of China&rsquo;s development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But what exactly do they mean by a &ldquo;new era&rdquo;? What are the common characteristics of these three eras and what can they tell us about China&rsquo;s path forward?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The three eras share three common themes: first, opponents of the dominant leader must be removed from office, some through retirement, but others through purges; second, the party puts forward a new guiding ideology attributed to this one leader, which all party members must follow unquestionably and in a &ldquo;unified&rdquo; manner; and, third, China takes on a historic task, which all members must unswervingly seek to attain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While many analysts see the first era starting in 1949, preparations for it actually began in Yan&rsquo;an, the communist base in Shaanxi province where the party settled after the 1934-35 Long March. During the Rectification Campaign of 1942, all party members were forced into intensive study sessions to internalise the newly emerging Mao Zedong Thought, creating &ldquo;unified thinking&rdquo; within the party.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Former top leader Liu Shaoqi, himself a victim of Maoist purges during the <a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/topics/cultural-revolution-0\">Cultural Revolution</a>, penned a major essay for study, called &ldquo;How to be a good communist&rdquo;, which set out the appropriate actions and thoughts for party members. Those who resisted this call for ideological conformity were purged. Many victims were linked to a group of 28 who had studied in Moscow. Other targets were the so-called &ldquo;bourgeois intellectuals&rdquo; who had moved to Yan&rsquo;an after 1937 to support the party in its fight against the Japanese who had invaded China that year. As nationalists, they were deemed unreliable and forced out of the party.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><em><a href=\"https://multimedia.scmp.com/cultural-revolution/\">Multimedia: Cultural Revolution, 50 years on</a></em></h4>\r\n\r\n<p><a class=\"colorbox colorbox-insert-image\" href=\"https://cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/10/25/cc756820-b93d-11e7-affb-32c8d8b6484e_image_hires_141131.JPG\" rel=\"gallery-35f44246-b87e-11e7-affb-32c8d8b6484e\"><img class=\"caption\" data-resolution=\"2\" height=\"601\" src=\"https://cdn2.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/10/25/cc756820-b93d-11e7-affb-32c8d8b6484e_972x_141131.JPG\" title=\"Chinese communist leader Liu Shaoqi and his wife Wang Guangmei pose for a photo in Beijing in 1949.

In 1943, the top party leaders secretly decided that Mao would have the last word on all policy decisions, and in 1945, at the 7th party congress, &ldquo;Mao Zedong Thought&rdquo; was enshrined in the party constitution, further elevating Mao&rsquo;s status over the other leaders, as the party prepared for the great historic task at hand &ndash; winning the civil war with the Kuomintang and unifying the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-300w caption\" data-style-type=\"default\" data-writer=\"Staff\" height=\"354\" src=\"http://stag.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/300w/public/2018/01/08/test_portrait_img.jpg?itok=0xMyvlVr\" width=\"236\" /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blockquote-quote blockquote-style-1 blockquote-style-1-title\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blockquote-quote blockquote-style-2 blockquote-style-2-title\">11th party congress</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blockquote-author blockquote-style-2 blockquote-style-2-description\">The second era began with the third plenum of the 11th party congress in December 1978, but for more than a decade, two factions vied for power. Throughout the 1980s, reformers and conservatives battled intensely over policy, power and personnel. Society, too, was actively engaged. But after the 1989 <a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/topics/tiananmen-square-crackdown\">Tiananmen crackdown</a> in Beijing and around the nation, the party&rsquo;s reform wing was systematically removed from office, its political reforms and liberal ideas were put to rest, and the faction&rsquo;s leader, Zhao Ziyang, spent the next 15 years under virtual house arrest.</div>\r\n\r\n<h4><em><a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/1991837/documents-reformist-icon-zhao-ziyang-give-rare-insight\">Documents from reformist icon Zhao Ziyang give rare insight into China at crossroads</a></em></h4>\r\n\r\n<p><img class=\"caption\" data-resolution=\"2\" height=\"385\" src=\"https://cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/10/25/cad322ea-b93e-11e7-affb-32c8d8b6484e_1320x770_141131.JPG\" title=\"Then Communist Party general secretary Zhao Ziyang addresses the student hunger strikers through a megaphone, on May 19, 1989, at Tiananmen Square in Beijing.

Photo: AFP\" width=\"660\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ironically, the purge of the reformers created the political context for the new era of political stability and rapid economic growth. With his &ldquo;southern trip&rdquo; in January 1992, Deng single-handedly reinvigorated economic reform, and the party, at its 14th party congress that fall, announced the construction of a &ldquo;socialist market economy&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blockquote-quote\">For almost 20 years, top leaders shared the common goal of enriching the country through daring economic reforms, all the while abjuring political liberalisation</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Thereafter, for almost 20 years, top leaders shared the common goal of enriching the country through daring economic reforms, all the while abjuring political liberalisation. No doubt, issues such as the massive privatisation of 1996-2000, Jiang Zemin&rsquo;s idea of letting capitalists into the party, or the decision to join the World Trade Organisation led to some sharp inner party disagreements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both Jiang and Hu Jintao each removed a member of the Politburo on the eve of their second term of office as general secretary, to demonstrate their power. However, during the Hu era, competing power centres emerged within the party, and factional disputes emerged. Still, due to an overall consensus on the best path for rapidly developing China, the party successfully strengthened China and significantly improved the lives of most Chinese citizens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The emergence of the third era, <a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/2115970/xi-lays-out-path-confident-new-era-china\">heralded last week</a> at the 19th party congress, follows the same pattern. For several years now, General Secretary Xi Jinping has relentlessly purged his opponents under the aegis of his tough <a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/topics/xi-jinpings-anti-graft-campaign\">anti-corruption campaign</a>. Two former members of the very powerful Central Military Commission were ingloriously arrested, as was <a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/topics/zhou-yongkang\">Zhou Yongkang</a>, a previous member of the Politburo Standing Committee. Only months before the 19th congress, Xi <a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/2103907/ex-chongqing-communist-party-boss-under-investigation\">arrested the party secretary of Chongqing</a>, once a candidate for the post of premier in 2022.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"methode-html-wrapper\">\r\n<div><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://multimedia.scmp.com/widgets/china/19th-congress/index.html\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Xi himself was <a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/2116830/congress-concludes-xi-undisputed-core-leader\">declared the &ldquo;core&rdquo; of the party leadership</a>, granting him decision-making authority similar to Mao&rsquo;s after 1943.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><em><a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/week-asia/opinion/article/2116135/analysis-what-chinas-leadership-reshuffle-means-xi-jinpings-new\">Analysis: What China&rsquo;s leadership reshuffle means for Xi Jinping&rsquo;s new era</a></em></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Xi has been laying out many new ideas on governance, foreign policy, party construction, ideological conformity, resolving social inequality and economic development, all of which have come together at the party congress as a new &ldquo;thought&rdquo;. This &ldquo;thought&rdquo;, now bearing Xi&rsquo;s name, places him on a pedestal equal to Mao and above Deng, whose ideas, after his death, were only called a &ldquo;theory&rdquo;. The 19th party congress articulated the new &ldquo;Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era&rdquo;, even labelling it as appropriate for other countries seeking independent economic development without interference from the institutions of international capitalism.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><em><a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/2116836/xi-jinping-thought-communist-partys-tighter-grip-china\">Xi Jinping Thought &ndash; the Communist Party&rsquo;s tighter grip on China in 16 characters</a></em></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, Xi and other leaders have set out the historic new task for the next three decades. Internally, the goal is to resolve the imbalance between uneven development and the people&rsquo;s material needs &ndash; suggesting that growth with equality will now occur. But more important, Xi has announced that the third era will build China into a very powerful state that can fulfil the &ldquo;China Dream&rdquo; and re-establish China as a, if not the, world leader.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>&lsquo;Xi Jinping Thought&rsquo; enshrined in the party charter</h5>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" class=\"c1\" data-orientation=\"landscape\" data-orientation-landscape=\"1m8t8g\" data-orientation-landscape-nid=\"2116807\" data-poster=\"https://cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/video/images/2017/10/24/xi_jinping.jpg\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"370\" src=\"https://widgets.scmp.com/video/video_iframe.php?id=1m8t8g&amp;poster=https%3A//cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/video/images/2017/10/24/xi_jinping.jpg\" width=\"600\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<p>But the Chinese leadership must be careful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The desire to re-establish China&rsquo;s greatness on the world stage is understandable. And in retrospect, the three eras show a logical progression from re-establishing national unity, quickly becoming a moderately wealthy country, and now building comprehensive national power.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><em><a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/2115025/under-xi-jinping-return-one-man-rule-china\">Reform or repression: what will the next five years bring for China?</a></em></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>But a political system that is highly centralised, ideologically driven, under one charismatic, almost all-powerful leader, with striking ambitions of global military grandeur and influence, could also be a recipe for disaster, as it closes out alternative ideas within its leadership, risks military overexpansion, suppresses all societal expression, and generates international coalitions of states that fear its escalating power.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thus in this third era, China is at a crossroads &ndash; will it be the confident and constructive China that solves its own dilemmas and contributes positively to resolving the world&rsquo;s problems, or a more aggressive China, which itself becomes a problem?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Dr David Zweig is chair professor in the Division of Social Science and director of the Centre on China&rsquo;s Transnational Relations, at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology</strong></p>\r\n",

As he strode to the podium of the Great Hall of the People and delivered his extraordinarily long speech at the opening of the <a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/chinas-leadership-reshuffle-2017\">Communist Party&rsquo;s 19th congress</a> on Wednesday, Xi laid out an ambitious vision not only for his upcoming second term of five years, but more importantly for the next 30 years. China would become &ldquo;a great modern socialist country&rdquo; by the middle of the 21 century, Xi said to the applause of about 2,300 party delegates for the one-week meeting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img class=\"caption\" data-resolution=\"2\" height=\"385\" src=\"https://cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/10/23/27f4b862-b4a8-11e7-95c2-e7a557915c7a_1320x770_154917.JPG\" title=\"Chinese President Xi Jinping. Photo: AFP\" width=\"660\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Xi made no bones about his own leadership role and his own place in the annals of party history as he declared China had entered a new era and the party had embarked on a new journey that would propel it to the centre-stage of the world, thus living up to his call to fulfil the Chinese dream of national rejuvenation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While his marathon speech of <a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/2115970/xi-lays-out-path-confident-new-era-china\">three hours and nearly 30 minutes</a> touched on almost everything &ndash; from politics to economics to Hong Kong and Taiwan to foreign relations &ndash; it boiled down to this fundamental conclusion: as the party tightens its grip on &ldquo;everything&rdquo;, it will also do whatever it can to fulfil the Chinese people&rsquo;s aspirations for a better life in exchange for the legitimacy to maintain authoritarian rule at home.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>WATCH: Marathon Xi Jinping speech</h6>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" class=\"c1\" data-orientation=\"landscape\" data-orientation-landscape=\"2o4r3w\" data-orientation-landscape-nid=\"2115967\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"370\" src=\"https://widgets.scmp.com/video/video_iframe.php?id=2o4r3w\" width=\"600\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Internationally, Xi clearly intends to promote China&rsquo;s ways of developing its economy with authoritarian rule and without espousing Western values &ndash; a model known as &lsquo;socialism with Chinese characteristics&rsquo; &ndash; as a model for other countries to follow.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" class=\"c1\" data-orientation=\"landscape\" data-orientation-landscape=\"2o4r3w\" data-orientation-landscape-nid=\"2115967\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"370\" src=\"https://widgets.scmp.com/video/video_iframe.php?id=2o4r3w\" width=\"600\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It offers a new option for other countries and nations who want to speed up their development while preserving their independence,&rdquo; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/2116411/seasoned-duo-tipped-take-key-jobs-communist-party\">China&rsquo;s new leadership line-up revealed in full for first time</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Xinhua commentary went further, exclaiming that Xi&rsquo;s speech signalled that &ldquo;the 21st century is likely to see capitalism lose its appeal while the socialist movement, led by China, rapidly catches up&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On a different note, Xi&rsquo;s marathon speech, which would have tested the physical fitness of any 64-year-old, should also help put to rest any lingering concerns about his health since he came to power in 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As expected, Xi&rsquo;s grand vision and rationale expounded in the speech will be written into the party&rsquo;s constitution when the congress closes on Tuesday. Already, following Xi&rsquo;s speech, other Chinese leaders have started to heap praise on the new body of political theory that will bear his name &ndash; &ldquo;Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This will put Xi on par with Mao Zedong, who was still in power when thoughts bearing his name were enshrined in the party constitution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a top Chinese leader who enjoys sweeping power, Xi needs to pursue three goals: to have his thoughts enshrined as guiding theories in the party constitution, exercise absolute control of the armed forces, and appoint his own supporters to fill the 25-member Politburo and its smaller seven-member standing committee (the highest governing council for the party and country).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having effectively achieved the first two goals, the final test will come on Wednesday morning when Xi is expected to lead the other six members of the Politburo Standing Committee onto a stage in the Great Hall of the People to meet the press.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/week-asia/opinion/article/2115287/xis-new-era-beckons-chinas-leadership-reshuffle-may-not-be\" title=\"www.scmp.com\">Xi era beckons, but leadership rejig may not be as expected</a></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Many overseas media and analysts see the new composition of the committee as the ultimate test of Xi&rsquo;s power and an indicator of his intentions regarding whether he plans to hold on to power longer than expected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As exclusively reported by the <em>South China Morning Post</em> over the past few days, the new leadership line-up will most likely be this: Xi Jinping, Li Keqiang, Li Zhanshu, Han Zheng, Wang Huning, Zhao Leji, and Wang Yang. If this list proves accurate and the political rankings of the line-up mimic the current composition of the committee, it will certainly run contrary to the predictions of many overseas analysts. It will also send multiple interesting signals regarding Xi&rsquo;s governance style for the years to come.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img class=\"caption\" data-resolution=\"2\" height=\"385\" src=\"https://cdn2.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/10/23/ebd951c8-b4aa-11e7-95c2-e7a557915c7a_1320x770_154917.jpg\" title=\"Li Keqiang at the opening of the congress.

The composition of the new line-up also reflects his considerations of interests from other party factions, including the Shanghai faction headed by Jiang Zemin and the Communist Youth League headed by Hu Jintao, Xi&rsquo;s two predecessors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Contrary to speculation, Li Keqiang, hailing from the Communist Youth League, will remain as premier for the next five years with his political ranking unchanged at No 2 in the party hierarchy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img class=\"caption\" data-resolution=\"2\" height=\"385\" src=\"https://cdn2.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/10/23/23950d14-b4ab-11e7-95c2-e7a557915c7a_1320x770_154917.JPG\" title=\"Wang Qishan. Photo: Handout\" width=\"660\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wang Qishan, Xi&rsquo;s trusted ally in charge of the anti-corruption campaign, will step down from the committee because he has reached the retirement age. Chen Miner, Xi&rsquo;s prot&eacute;g&eacute;, will not make it into the committee. This signals that Xi has closely followed the rules regarding age limits and seniority when considering candidates for the top posts, again contrary to speculation he would break rules to his advantage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img class=\"caption\" data-resolution=\"2\" height=\"385\" src=\"https://cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/10/23/2de39ef2-b4ab-11e7-95c2-e7a557915c7a_1320x770_154917.JPG\" title=\"Chen Miner. Photo: Handout\" width=\"660\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Li Zhanshu, one of Xi&rsquo;s most trusted lieutenants, is most likely to become the chairman of the National People&rsquo;s Congress. This should come as a surprise as he was long rumoured to head the anti-graft watchdog after Wang&rsquo;s retirement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img align=\"left\" class=\"caption align-left c2\" data-resolution=\"2\" height=\"412\" src=\"https://cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/10/23/6205b06c-b4ab-11e7-95c2-e7a557915c7a_600x_154917.JPG\" title=\"Li Zhanshu. File photo\" width=\"300\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The elevation of Han Zheng, the party secretary of Shanghai, Jiang&rsquo;s power base, is widely expected. There had been suggestions he could become the executive vice-premier, but taking over the helm of the Chinese People&rsquo;s Political Consultative Conference &ndash; the fourth ranked job in the party hierarchy &ndash; should give him more status and prestige.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img class=\"caption\" data-resolution=\"2\" height=\"385\" src=\"https://cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/10/23/84b3dff8-b4ab-11e7-95c2-e7a557915c7a_1320x770_154917.JPG\" title=\"Han Zheng. Photo: AP\" width=\"660\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The induction of Wang Huning, a trusted party theoretician who has advised three presidents from Jiang to Hu and now Xi on building their political thoughts, will also be a surprise to some analysts who widely believe the party prefers its top committee leaders to have prior hands-on experience managing one or two provinces as party chief. But there was an exception back in 2002 when Wen Jiabao was named on the committee and later became the premier despite having no experience of managing any province.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img class=\"caption\" data-resolution=\"2\" height=\"385\" src=\"https://cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/10/23/d6cf8558-b4ab-11e7-95c2-e7a557915c7a_1320x770_154917.JPG\" title=\"Wang Huning. File photo\" width=\"660\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zhao Leji taking over the anti-graft watchdog may also seem surprising at first glance, but a closer look indicates good rationale behind the appointment. Over the past five years, Zhao has been in charge of the party&rsquo;s powerful Organisation Department, responsible for managing the careers of millions of party officials. As China&rsquo;s anti-corruption campaign is aimed at rooting out official corruption, his experience should come in handy in his new job.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img class=\"caption\" data-resolution=\"2\" height=\"385\" src=\"https://cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/10/23/f53729ce-b4ab-11e7-95c2-e7a557915c7a_1320x770_154917.JPG\" title=\"Zhao Leji. Photo: Xinhua\" width=\"660\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last but not least, the elevation of Wang Yang to the position of executive vice-premier, is expected. Wang, who worked his way up in the Communist Youth League, proved his skills in managing complex economic matters while party chief of Chongqing and of Guangdong, and in his current role as a vice-premier in charge of agriculture and foreign trade. Over the past five years, as the official in charge of the poverty alleviation campaign, one of Xi&rsquo;s top priorities, Wang has also proved his loyalty. As China&rsquo;s point man on dealing with Washington over economic and trade matters, Wang&rsquo;s elevation should be welcomed by foreign investors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img class=\"caption\" data-resolution=\"2\" height=\"385\" src=\"https://cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/10/23/1c30816a-b4ac-11e7-95c2-e7a557915c7a_1320x770_154917.JPG\" title=\"Wang Yang. Photo: Bloomberg\" width=\"660\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The likelihood that both Hu Chunhua and Chen Miner have failed to make it to the Politburo Standing Committee should come as a bigger surprise to many observers, but not readers of this column.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As previously written in this column, Xi&rsquo;s decision in July to topple Sun Zhengcai, former party chief of Chongqing and a Politburo member, was clearly intended as a signal that he no longer recognised the previous successor arrangements. Sun and Hu, both of them born in the 1960s, were picked by Jiang and Hu to be groomed as potential successors to Xi and Li Keqiang.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/week-asia/opinion/article/2109398/chinas-leadership-reshuffle-whats-behind-xi-jinpings-poker-face\" title=\"www.scmp.com\">China&rsquo;s leadership reshuffle: what&rsquo;s behind Xi&rsquo;s poker face?</a></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, elevating Chen onto the standing committee would mean he would have to jump two rungs from his current political position as a mere member of the Central Committee, which would run contrary to the seniority based system and risk a backlash from inside the party.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, with Chen set to join the bigger Politburo and Hu remaining as a Politburo member, the compromise will be better received by all party factions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img class=\"caption\" data-resolution=\"2\" height=\"385\" src=\"https://cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/10/23/2b407d86-b4a7-11e7-95c2-e7a557915c7a_1320x770_154917.JPG\" title=\"Chinese President Xi Jinping with former president Hu Jintao (left) and former president Jiang Zemin. Photo: EPA\" width=\"660\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, the new line-up without a potential successor in sight might trigger more speculation about whether Xi will hold on to power beyond his second term. But the arrangement might also signal a new approach by Xi over the successor issue &ndash; namely, potential candidates will have to prove themselves at the Politburo level before getting an opportunity to rise to the next level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Either way, such a leadership line-up will help entrench Xi&rsquo;s position as China&rsquo;s next paramount leader, something underlined by the fact that Jiang, Hu and the rest of the retired Politburo Standing Committee members all braved the cold weather to lend their appearance and applaud Xi&rsquo;s speech at the opening ceremony. <span class=\"tw_sectioncolor\"><span class=\"courier\">&#9632;</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong class=\"footnote\">Wang Xiangwei is the former editor-in-chief of the South China Morning Post.

				"body": "<p>Party congresses in China, which occur at five-year intervals, tend to be of two varieties: consolidating or transitional. Those that occur at 10-year intervals allow for a transition of the <a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/topics/chinas-communist-party\">Communist Party</a> leadership from one general secretary to another, and often one political generation to another. Interim congresses &ndash; such as the upcoming 19th &ndash; are more about the consolidation of power by the incumbent leader and his agenda.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>aaa</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This will certainly be the case this time &ndash; with all signs pointing to an impressive solidification of power by <a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/topics/xi-jinping\">Xi Jinping</a>. Xi seems poised for a clean sweep over personnel and policy, and the congress will certainly portray the party and the country as moving inexorably towards greater wealth and power, reform and opening, international standing, and implementation of &ldquo;Xi Jinping Thought&rdquo; (which is likely to be written into the party constitution, placing Xi on a par with Chairman Mao).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the narrative of a strong and forward-moving China will be prominent, a variety of unresolved questions and issues underlie the veneer of unity and purpose that the congress will present to the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Concerning top party personnel, there are a number of uncertainties, given that roughly half of both the Central Committee and Politburo members will change, as well as five of the seven Politburo Standing Committee members. All analysts anticipate many of these top positions will be filled by Xi&rsquo;s acolytes &ndash; mainly men who previously worked with him in Zhejiang or Fujian.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><em><a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/2114016/friends-high-places-xi-jinpings-determined-path-control\">Friends in high places: Xi Jinping&rsquo;s determined path to control</a></em></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Rumours fly about who will get what post. Other than the premiership &ndash; still uncertain and contested among <a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/topics/li-keqiang\">Li Keqiang</a>, <a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/topics/wang-qishan\">Wang Qishan</a> and <a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/topics/wang-yang\">Wang Yang</a> &ndash; and the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection portfolio (where Xi&rsquo;s right-hand man Li Zhanshu seems to have a lock on the top post), the others are all essentially interchangeable parts and musical chairs. It doesn&rsquo;t really matter which institutional portfolios Wang Huning, Han Zheng, Zhao Leji, Chen Miner, Hu Chunhua, Liu Qibao, Cai Qi, and Sun Chunlan get, as they all lack political gravitas and defer to Xi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What does this mean for China&rsquo;s political system and what kind of ruling party has the Communist Party become? Given Xi&rsquo;s all-powerful persona, China&rsquo;s political system has reverted to a patriarchal-patrimonial system &ndash; a form of governance where power rests with the imperial-type leader and not with institutions. Sociologist Max Weber identified this as &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; and &ldquo;feudal&rdquo; patrimonialism &ndash; as the ruling party or monarchy becomes hegemonically dominated by a single ruler, rather than institutionally dispersed into a meritocratic and enfranchised bureaucracy. Xi&rsquo;s total dominance of the party, state and military personifies Weber&rsquo;s patrimonialism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img class=\"caption\" data-resolution=\"2\" height=\"385\" src=\"https://cdn2.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/10/20/5e98ef74-af02-11e7-9cb1-5f6b75e2d8b2_1320x770_133810.jpg\" title=\"An artist in Xiayi, Henan province, works on a 3D street painting of the emblem of the Chinese Communist Party to celebrate the upcoming party congress.

Recall that, beginning with Deng Xiaoping in 1978, the party has very consciously sought to disperse power away from an almighty ruler. Deng was quite explicit that the over-concentration of power in one man &ndash; Mao Zedong &ndash; was what had led China down a disastrous path for two decades, from 1956 to 1976. To rectify this malady, for the past four decades, the party has sought to devolve power within the central party, separate party from government, and devolve authority from Beijing to provinces and localities. The whole decision-making system was to be based on consultation and collective decision-making, following technocratic expert input. Xi has reversed all of these norms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Xi&rsquo;s accumulation of personal power combined with his aggressive <a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/topics/xi-jinpings-anti-graft-campaign\">anti-corruption campaign</a> have deeply undermined the system Deng and his successors sought to build. Moreover, Xi&rsquo;s anti-corruption campaign, however necessary, has decimated the political patronage system. Practical perks for cadres have been taken away and replaced by demands of fidelity to Xi as the <a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/2040675/chinese-communist-party-expands-xi-jinpings-political\">&ldquo;core&rdquo; of the party</a>. Political systems based on loyalty to a single ruler are politically vulnerable, and usually lack broad-based legitimacy and longevity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img class=\"caption\" data-resolution=\"2\" height=\"385\" src=\"https://cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/10/20/4c8dacb6-af02-11e7-9cb1-5f6b75e2d8b2_1320x770_133810.jpg\" title=\"A plaque engraved with a picture of President Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liyuan is displayed at a stall at Panjiayuan Antique market in Beijing this week. Political systems based on loyalty to a single ruler are politically vulnerable, and usually lack broad-based legitimacy and longevity. Photo: EPA-EFE\" width=\"660\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, as intended, the anti-corruption campaign has ruthlessly destroyed various factions in the party, state, military and internal security apparatuses. Many &ldquo;iron rice bowls&rdquo; have been shattered. Surely, this has severely stressed these institutional systems, which has resulted in the &ldquo;freezing up&rdquo; of these bureaucracies, and the technocratic mode of policymaking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Xi has also effectively dismantled the power bases of his two predecessors <a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/topics/jiang-zemin\">Jiang Zemin</a> and <a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/topics/hu-jintao\">Hu Jintao</a> &ndash; the Shanghai and Youth League factions respectively. The internal and state security apparatuses &ndash; previously under the control of now imprisoned <a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/topics/zhou-yongkang\">Zhou Yongkang</a> &ndash; have been gutted and replaced with presumed Xi loyalists. The propaganda apparatus has endured a similar d&eacute;nouement, which has had a devastating impact &ndash; unseen since the post-Tiananmen period &ndash; on civil society, the public sphere, media, intellectuals and the education system. Xi is China&rsquo;s most illiberal leader since Mao.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><em><a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/2111123/does-chinese-leader-xi-jinping-plan-hang-power-more-10\">Does Chinese leader Xi Jinping plan to hang on to power for more than 10 years?</a></em></h4>\r\n\r\n<p><img class=\"caption\" data-resolution=\"2\" height=\"385\" src=\"https://cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/10/20/de01007e-af04-11e7-9cb1-5f6b75e2d8b2_1320x770_133810.jpg\" title=\"Runners pass in front of the large portrait of Mao Zedong on Tiananmen Gate, at the start of the Beijing Marathon on September 17.

Photo: AP\" width=\"660\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perhaps most noteworthy has been the shake-up, shakedown and shakeout in the military &ndash; where over 4,000 officers, 100 generals, and four Central Military Commission members have been relieved of their duties. Taken together with the sweeping reorganisation of the People&rsquo;s Liberation Army high command that Xi launched in January 2016, the military may be reeling from these twin pincers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, these purges have affected more than 500,000 individuals in China and they surely have taken their toll on morale throughout the country&rsquo;s elite &ndash; although the campaign is very popular with the masses. Ironically, Xi&rsquo;s attempt to strengthen the party may, in fact, have further damaged it as an institution. The party is now akin to a military organisation &ndash; where orders are given and followed, with no operative feedback mechanisms or what is described as &ldquo;inner-party life&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><em><a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/2114471/being-xi-jinping-difficult-art-juggling-growth-and\">Being Xi Jinping: the difficult art of juggling growth and control</a></em></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>This raises a related question, often speculated about: Is Xi &ldquo;cracking down before opening up?&rdquo; In Mao&rsquo;s words, is Xi &ldquo;cleaning house before inviting in the guests?&rdquo; After the past five years of heavy-handed domestic repression, will Xi&rsquo;s second term be characterised by a return to a more liberal &ldquo;soft authoritarianism&rdquo; and limited political reform? Will the past four years of policy stasis and minimal implementation of the ambitious <a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/topics/chinas-third-plenum\">Third Plenum</a> economic reforms now be followed by assertive implementation? Don&rsquo;t bet on the former &ndash; and bet on the latter only if Wang Qishan becomes the next premier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img class=\"caption\" data-resolution=\"2\" height=\"385\" src=\"https://cdn2.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/10/20/75be2d6c-af03-11e7-9cb1-5f6b75e2d8b2_1320x770_133810.jpg\" title=\"President Xi Jinping (left), Politburo Standing Committee member Wang Qishan (centre) and Premier Li Keqiang attend a ceremony marking Martyrs' Day at Tiananmen Square in Beijing on September 30.

If Wang does get the premiership, it will be the best thing for China &ndash; as more robust implementation of the Third Plenum package can be expected. No one else in the leadership has the political clout, combined with deep knowledge of the economic system, to roll out the reforms.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blockquote-quote\">The party&rsquo;s severe political controls domestically and its hesitancy on economic reforms are juxtaposed with a very confident China on the world stage</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Party congresses are usually much more about continuity than change, as they largely recap the past five years. Nonetheless, the general secretary&rsquo;s work report will offer a comprehensive overview of various policy arenas and could indicate some new policy departures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One sphere where continuity can be anticipated is in foreign policy. With Xi&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/topics/belt-and-road-initiative\">Belt and Road Initiative</a>&rdquo;, &ldquo;new type of major country relations&rdquo; and many other initiatives, China&rsquo;s foreign policy is in sound shape overall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This raises a final question: the contradiction between a seemingly insecure party leadership reflected in its internal policies, and a very secure leadership on external foreign policies. The party&rsquo;s severe political controls domestically and its hesitancy on economic reforms are juxtaposed with a very confident China on the world stage. Will the post-congress leadership begin to exhibit confidence domestically to open up the polity, society and economy &ndash; to match China&rsquo;s confidence internationally? However wishful, don&rsquo;t bet on it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>David Shambaugh is professor and director of the China Policy Programme at George Washington University and author of China&rsquo;s Future</strong></p>\r\n",

The new line-up, if confirmed, shows that he is careful not to break the age rule and to follow the order of seniority. These political norms are critical for the 89-million member Communist Party to have consensus at the top and maintain stability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/2116830/congress-concludes-xi-undisputed-core-leader\">Congress concludes with President Xi Jinping as undisputed &lsquo;core&rsquo; leader</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span class=\"courier\">&#9679;</span> But Xi is also not blindly following the established path. He has made a decision with far-reaching consequences in not naming a clear-cut successor and promoting his choice to the Politburo Standing Committee. This opens the way for China to rethink its power transition mechanism and to give several possible candidates time to prove themselves. The breakaway from the designated successor system introduced by paramount leader Deng Xiaoping is a highlight of this leadership reshuffle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span class=\"courier\">&#9679;</span> By putting Li Zhanshu &ndash; his most trusted ally &ndash; as head of the National People&rsquo;s Congress and Zhao Leji, the youngest among the seven, as the anti-graft chief, Xi has signalled a desire to further institutionalise the party and state power. Li could help Xi push for legal reform that will clarify grey areas in the legal system and enhance the party&rsquo;s governance through legal means. Zhao, with his background in personnel arrangements, can introduce more systematic changes to anti-graft work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span class=\"courier\">&#9679;</span> The elevation of Wang Huning and <a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/2116549/xi-finds-perfect-position-trusted-adviser-liu-he\">Liu He</a>, if confirmed, would signal the pressing need for the president to craft new theoretical support for his reform programmes, which is different from the western understanding of liberalism. The president will restructure the party and the state to improve efficiency, tighten discipline and guard against the influx of western ideas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Changes at the state level, such as who will head the NPC or the CPPCC, will only be announced early next year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other than the Politburo Standing Committee line-up, the changes of personnel at two little known but influential departments will also be important. <a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/2116701/low-key-powerful-protector-chinas-leaders-and-their\">The party&rsquo;s general office and the central secretariat</a> &ndash; its nerve centre in charge of day-to-day operations &ndash; will also change leaders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <em>Post</em> will continue to bring you exclusive reports and analysis on China&rsquo;s most important political meeting in half a decade.</p>\r\n",
